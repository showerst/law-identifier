Examples of how they appear within the code:

* 1:16
* 1:58.3
* 2:131.1
* 33:9681
* 46:236.11.4
* 47:287.663
* 47:9081

Often prefixed by "RS" or "R.S."

```
((R(\.?)S(\.?)\s)?)([0-9]{1,2}):([0-9]{1,4})((\.[0-9]+)*)
```

May omit `((R(\.?)S(\.?)\s)?)` for broader matching with relatively high confidence that it will not result in overbroad matching.
