Examples of how they appear within the code:

* § 1410
* § 6502

Section numbers are not unique, but repeat for each title. The first two digits are the chapter number, they start at “01” (e.g., 1401). Because chapters start at 1, this means that section numbers can be 3–4 digits long.

In court decisions, they are cited as such:

* Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, § 6502

```
Del. Code Ann. tit. ([0-9]{1,2}), § ([0-9]{3,4})
