Onto Michigan. These rulings' citations are also pleasantly consistent.  They all are prefixed with "MCL ". (Not to be confused with "MCR" (Michigan Court Rules) or "MCE" (Michigan Rules of Evidence), which are not laws, but rules established by the court system.)

These are the only two ways that I can find them used:

*MCL 600.1060 to 600.1082
*MCL 257.732

```
MCL\s([0-9]{1})([0-9]*)\.([0-9a-z]+)
```

That returns 2,602 results from the 2,393 opinions, or an average of just one per opinion. That sounds like rather few, but so many of the opinions are not accompanied by an opinion that I'm not sure that it tells us much at all. I'd run a comparative search for `([0-9]{1})([0-9]*)\.([0-9a-z]+)`, but that retrieves any number that contains a decimal, making it so broad as to be meaningless.

Anecdotally, paging through the results of a search for the PCRE, the results look very solid.
