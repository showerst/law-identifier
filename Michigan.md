Michigan court rulings' citations are fairly consistent.  They all are prefixed with "MCL ". (Not to be confused with "MCR" (Michigan Court Rules) or "MCE" (Michigan Rules of Evidence), which are not laws, but rules established by the court system.)

These are the only two ways that I can find them used:

* MCL 600.1060 to 600.1082
* MCL 257.732

```
MCL\s([0-9]{1})([0-9]*)\.([0-9a-z]+)
```

Anecdotally, paging through the results of a search for the PCRE, the results look very solid.
