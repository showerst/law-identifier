Texas

* Sec. 53.033
* Sec. 52.0165
* Sec. 3151.101
* Art. 7621f
* Sec. 4A.101

(Often "Section," sometimes "Sect." )

So there are article, and sections. I have no idea what the difference is -- they seem to be used interchangeably.

In court opinions, citations appear as:

* Tex. Nat. Res. Code § 61.011
* Tex. Nat. Res. Code § 61.011, .0161
* Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.001
* Tex. Prop.Code Ann. §§ 21.015-.015
* Tex. Educ. Code § 21.307

Note that "Prop.Code" is not a typo. That style was employed repeatedly.

On second use, the major identifer is omitted, and replaced with "Id."
